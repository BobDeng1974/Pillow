# Pillow
a 3d modeler

Pillow is a light-weight 3D modeler that tries to mimic what Silo is. http://www.nevercenter.com/silo/

In 2003, there was this SARS epidemic outbreak in Beijing. School was shut down and we had a really long summer. I got bored and decided to learn 3D Studio Max myself. And then for the following few years, all I wanted to do was computer graphics. 

Pillow was a program I wrote during 2006. A project I was really proud of. I didn't know about half-edge or winged-edge at the time, so I made up my own datastructure. The UI was based on WxWidget. I tried to update it during graduate school with Qt and a more mature datastructure, but I couldn't finish. Today, I finally found the old source code from a dusty harddrive, I decided to uploaded it here and if I have time, I will mordenize it with Qt and OpenSubdiv.
